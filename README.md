# JavaScriptmas

ðŸŽ„ This repository contains my solution to the JavaScriptmas challenge organized by Scrimba

## Day 1

- Get today's date (you only need the day).
- Calculate remaining days.
- Display remaining days.

Stretch goals:

- Display hours, minutes, seconds.
- Add a countdown for another festival, your birthday, or Christmas 2022.

## Day 2

- Add 115deg gradient border with the provided colors, or choose your own
- Hover state: gradient colors flip horizontally, btn grows slightly in size, and the text changes from grey to white
