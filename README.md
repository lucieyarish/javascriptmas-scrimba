ðŸŽ„ This repository contains my solution to the JavaScriptmas challenge organized by Scrimba

## Day 1

- Get today's date (you only need the day)
- Calculate remaining days
- Display remaining days

Stretch goals:

- Display hours, minutes, seconds
- Add a countdown for another festival, your birthday, or Christmas 2022

## Day 2

- Add 115deg gradient border with the provided colors, or choose your own
- Hover state: gradient colors flip horizontally, btn grows slightly in size, and the text changes from grey to white

## Day 3

- Find the total number of pieces of candy the children can eat
- Example:
  -- Children: 3, Candies: 10
  -- Each of the 3 children can eat 3 candies, so the total number of candies that can be eaten is 3\*3 = 9

```
//TEST
calcTotalCandies(3, 10); // expected output: 9
calcTotalCandies(4, 20); // expected output: 20
calcTotalCandies(6, 25); // expected output: 24
```

## Day 4

- Use AI to generate a one-line Christmas joke
- When clicked, the doors should open to reveal a festive joke.
